# CryptoClustering
In this challenge I was tasked to use my previously learned python skills and newly learned unsupervised learnign skills to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
I enjoyed this challenge and thought it was pretty straight forward. I was able to review Activities from class to help with my coding and only used xpert learning assistant once at the end when i needed to Composite plot to contrast the Elbow curves. I had realised I had made a minor error in the first elbow plot even though it was still able to show the correct plotted curve. Overall I found this assignment helpful.
